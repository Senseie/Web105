    <h2>DIGITAL ART</h2>

    <p align-left> <img src="Project-1 Sea & Sky PetersonRGB.jpg" alt="ERP artwork" style="float: right" > This is one of my favorite pieces! This particular piece of art I combined approximately 10 copyright free photos from Pixabay and blended them in my own creativity. The overall expression of this piece is that of Mother Earth in tears as her body is exposed and disregarded by humankind...however Spirit is looking over her saying that even though everything appears to be in turmoil, everything is in perfect order and not to worry...</p>

    <p align-right>  <img src="Project3UndergroundPeterson1.jpg" alt="ERP Fantasy artwork" style="float: left" >I was a DayDreamer growing up as a little boy. This piece of digital art I created again using approximately 5 copyright free photos from Pixabay and blended them to create a whimsical wonderland.
