               <p>The Capitol City of San Juan, Puerto Rico has as much charm as she holds the mysteries of the Pirates of the Carribean. The block buster movie series was set somewhere amongst the beautiful islands surrounding the main isle of Puerto Rico</p>
              
               <p>The Capitol holds the old fort where there were many battles held protecting this beautiful island of mystery. The natives call themselves Taino! Native Puerto Rican Indian cultures ruled these lands for many centuries until the white man came and conquered.</p>
